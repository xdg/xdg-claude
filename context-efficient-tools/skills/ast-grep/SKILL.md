# ast-grep: Structural Code Search and Editing

Use ast-grep to solve the "old_string not unique" problem by matching code structure instead of exact text. This enables refactoring across formatting variations and structural patterns.

## When to Use ast-grep vs Text Tools

### Use ast-grep when:
- **Structural code changes** - Refactoring function signatures, method calls, class structures
- **Formatting-independent matching** - Need to find code regardless of whitespace/line breaks
- **Pattern variations** - Matching similar structures with different variable names/arguments
- **"old_string not unique" problem** - Edit tool fails because text appears in multiple contexts
- **Complex queries** - Finding nested structures, specific AST patterns

### Use text tools (Edit/Grep) when:
- **Simple, unique string replacement** - The exact text appears once or in consistent format
- **Non-code files** - Markdown, configs, data files
- **Comment/documentation edits** - Content that isn't code structure
- **Very small changes** - Single line, obvious context, no ambiguity

## Key Decision Rule

**If editing code structure and there's any ambiguity in text matching â†’ use ast-grep.**

ast-grep's primary value: **Solves the "old_string not unique" problem by matching structure instead of exact text.**
