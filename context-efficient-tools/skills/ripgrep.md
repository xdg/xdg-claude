# ripgrep: Powerful, one-shot text search

## Default Strategy

**For content search: use Bash(rg) with `-e 'pattern' -n -C 2` for one-shot results.**

This gives files, line numbers, and context in a single call - minimizes iterations and context usage.

Always prefer getting line numbers and surrounding context over multiple search attempts.

## Tool Selection

**Grep tool** (built on ripgrep) - Use for structured searches:
- Basic pattern matching with structured output
- File type filtering with `type` parameter
- When special flags like `-F`, `-v`, `-w`, or pipe composition are not needed
- Handles 95% of search needs

**Bash(rg)** - Use for one-shot searches needing special flags or composition:
- Fixed string search (`-F`)
- Invert match (`-v`)
- Word boundaries (`-w`)
- Context lines with patterns (`-n -C 2`)
- Pipe composition (`| head`, `| wc -l`, `| sort`)
- Default choice for efficient one-shot results

**Glob tool** - Use for file name/path matching only (not content search)

## When to Load Detailed Reference

Load [ripgrep guide](./references/ripgrep-guide.md) when needing:
- One-shot search pattern templates
- Effective flag combinations for complex searches
- Pipe composition patterns
- File type filters reference (`-t` flags)
- Pattern syntax examples
- Translation between Grep tool and rg commands
- Performance optimization for large result sets

The guide focuses on practical patterns for getting targeted results in minimal calls.
