# Writing Style Guide (compressed from The Elements of Style by Strunk & White)

**Default behavior**: Use these principles when generating, reviewing, or editing prose.

Conditional behavior: For creative efforts, consider these principles but give
deference to existing or requested styles. Ask for clarification if unsure how
to evaluate a text.

## Core Principles

**Use active voice.** Vigorous writing demands active voice over passive.
- ❌ My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me
- ✅ I shall always remember my first visit to Boston
- ❌ There were dead leaves lying on the ground
- ✅ Dead leaves covered the ground

**Put statements in positive form.** Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, hesitating, non-committal language. Use *not* for denial or antithesis, never for evasion.
- ❌ He was not very often on time → ✅ He usually came late
- ❌ did not remember → ✅ forgot
- ❌ did not pay attention to → ✅ ignored
- ❌ not honest → ✅ dishonest

**Use definite, specific, concrete language.** Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.
- ❌ A period of unfavorable weather set in
- ✅ It rained every day for a week
- ❌ He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward
- ✅ He grinned as he pocketed the coin

**Omit needless words.** Vigorous writing is concise. Make every word tell.

**Express coordinate ideas in parallel form.** Parallel construction enables readers to recognize likeness of content and function.
- ❌ Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed
- ✅ Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method

**Keep related words together.** Position shows relationship. Don't separate subject and verb with movable phrases.
- ❌ Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description
- ✅ In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description

**Place emphatic words at the end.** The end position gives prominence.
- ❌ Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways
- ✅ Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude

## Verbose Constructions to Avoid

| ❌ Wordy | ✅ Concise |
|---------|-----------|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | no doubt / doubtless |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| this is a subject which | this subject |
| owing to the fact that | since / because |
| in spite of the fact that | though / although |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you / notify you |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| the fact that I had arrived | my arrival |
| His brother, who is a member of | His brother, a member of |

## Empty/Hackneyed Words to Avoid

**case** - Usually unnecessary.
- ❌ In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated
- ✅ Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated

**certainly / very** - Indiscriminate intensifiers. A mannerism that weakens writing.

**character / nature** - Often simply redundant.
- ❌ Acts of a hostile character
- ✅ Hostile acts

**factor / feature** - Hackneyed words that usually add nothing.
- ❌ His superior training was the great factor in his winning
- ✅ He won the match by being better trained

**interesting** - Perfunctory introduction. Make it interesting; don't announce it.
- ❌ An interesting story is told of...
- ✅ (Tell the story without preamble)

**one of the most** - Threadbare formula. Forcible-feeble opening.

**however** (meaning "nevertheless") - Don't put it first in the sentence.
- ❌ The roads were almost impassable. However, we succeeded
- ✅ The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded
